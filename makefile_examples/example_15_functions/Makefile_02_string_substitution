# one, two and three all output the same results, just different ways to do it
#
# one: uses $(patsubst pattern,replacement,text) = all *.o files get replaces with *.c files inside text variable $(foo)  
# two: foo depends on all *.o files assign to all *.c files
# three: does the same as two

foo := a.o b.o l.a c.o
one := $(patsubst %.o,%.c,$(foo))
# This is a shorthand for the above
two := $(foo:%.o=%.c)
# This is the suffix-only shorthand, and is also equivalent to the above.
three := $(foo:.o=.c)

all:
	echo $(one)
	echo $(two)
	echo $(three)
# output:
# a.c b.c l.a c.c
# a.c b.c l.a c.c
# a.c b.c l.a c.c
