# error handling
# - behinde a command to supress the error and continue
# -i in the make command `make -i` will `ignore-errors` supress all error and execute commands that can be executed
# -k in the mame command `make -k` will `--keep-going` when some targes can't be made
# there is not much difference between `make` and `make -k`. -k is suppose to give more info about all errors

# Example
#one:
#	false # error, stop the make command
#	touch one #this wont run - `make -i` will force to skip errors and run this

one:two
	false # supress error and continue `make -i` will supress all commands and continue
	touch one # this will only run with `make -i`. `make` and `make -k` wont work
two:three
	-false
	touch two # will be created with make and make -k
three:
	touch three # will be created with make and make -k
clean:
	rm one two three
