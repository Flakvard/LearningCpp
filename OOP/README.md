# Object Oriented in C++

## Implemented four pillars of OO
    [x] Encapsulation:
            - Classes header files defined inside lib dir
            - Source C++ files declared inside src dir
            - Object files compiled inside build dir
    [x]  Inheritance:
            class IEmployee
                class AbstractEmployee
                    class Developer
                    class Teacher
            class IEmployeeFactory
                    class DeveloperFactory
                    class TeacherFactory
    [x]  Abstraction/interface:
            class IEmployee
            class AbstractEmployee
            class IEmployeeFactory
    [x]  Polymorhpish:
            class IEmployee
            class IEmployeeFactory
